      <h4>Carreer</h4>

      <p>
        I started at IBM back in 2016 where I first started working with Web
        pages HTML/CSS/JavaScript, moved on to an agile team of web development
        where I took care of IBM Watson Customer Engagement brand as the main
        developer, after that, I joined the Applications team as application
        full-stack developer in 2018 where I worked with front, backend, Vue.js,
        React, Node, Cloud, and DB having developed a chatbot for Corinthians
        soccer team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then in 2019 I joined the Carbon Design System team in IBM where I
        worked with an open source Project called Carbon For IBM.com working
        with React.js and other frameworks in an agile team practicing
        code-review, tests and continuous integration.
