        I'm Emerson Pereira.
        <br />
        This is a bit about me. My carreer, skills and some fun facts.
      </p>

      <h4>Carreer</h4>

      <p>
        I started at IBM back in 2016 where I first started working with Web
        pages HTML/CSS/JavaScript, moved on to an agile team of web development
        where I took care of IBM Watson Customer Engagement brand as the main
        developer, after that, I joined the Applications team as application
        full-stack developer in 2018 where I worked with front, backend, Vue.js,
        React, Node, Cloud, and DB having developed a chatbot for Corinthians
        soccer team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then in 2019 I joined the Carbon Design System team in IBM where I
        worked with an open source Project called Carbon For IBM.com working
        with React.js and other frameworks in an agile team practicing
        code-review, tests and continuous integration.
      </p>

      <h4>Skills</h4>

      <p>
        I have experience with Node.js and API development (REST and GraphQL),
        frontend frameworks, databases and Cloud.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a JavaScript coder. I have learned a lot of it over the years and
        continue to learn. I have been following up as the language evolves and,
        also, getting more familiar with its foundational principles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, I'm learning about TypeScript, Next.js, Nest.js, Gatsby.js,
        and other hot tech in the world of JavaScript and web development.
